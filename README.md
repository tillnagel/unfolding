## About
### Interaction Events
Unfolding enables you to rapidly create interactive maps. Basic interactions
such as Zoom & Pan are included. Other functionality such as Overview+Detail,
or multitouch gestures can be easily added.

### Data Visualization
Simply create geo-positioned markers to display data on a map. The visual style
can be adapted freely. The library supports any user-defined shapes, such as
points, lines, or polygons.

### Styled Maps
Unfolding is a tile-based map library. Map tiles can have various geographic
features, and come in all kind of styles. It comes with various map providers,
such as OpenStreetMap or TileMill.
